# templates

Templates is a easy way to setup a project within minutes or even seconds.
With Templates you can look for the most accurate pre-made project for your idea, and git clone it directly from the cli.

To install it, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skittlexyz/templates.git
cd templates
npm i # or any package manager you prefer
node index.js
```
> &nbsp;ðŸ“Œ To use it, you must have Git installed and configured in your environment variable path.

You can also submit your own templates to this project by contacting me. My contact info is on my [profile](https://github.com/skittlexyz).
Thanks for using and reading! Feel free to open an issue or contact me for improvements and/or comments.

### TODO:

- Fetch JSON file from repository to prevent clones with limited versions.
- Develop binary release versions or one-liner command so it's easier to use.
